"See You Again," Tyler's favorite song from Flower Boy, is a love song. Kali Uchis, who sang the songs "FIND YOUR WINGS" and "PERFECT" on Tyler's 2015 album Cherry Bomb, contributes vocals to the song. Since they only exist in his dreams and fantasies, the person Tyler sings to in this song appears to be his ideal partner. This person always vanishes as he wakes up, thus he doesn't want to wake up. Even though he is deeply in love with them, he dislikes having to wait and pursue them all the time. The song starts right after the interlude "Sometimes.." In it, a man's voice requests that Shane Powers play the song about him on Golf Radio. "See You Again" follows, which suggests that the song is probably about a man.
